This is the rebuilt source code for [jgwalsh.net](https://jgwalsh.net), the professional portfolio of **James Gregory Walsh**. It highlights his work across applied psychology, law enforcement readiness, civic technology, and public safety innovation.

This version replaces the older Jekyll-based layout with a cleaner, hand-coded HTML/CSS implementation powered by Tailwind CSS and deployed through Cloudflare Pages.
